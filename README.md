# CS210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- This project does simple data analysis for a mock grocery store. It takes an input file of "sold items" and counts the frequency of sale for each item. It then outputs a file with the formatted data. It gives the user a menu where they may do simple data analysis. It allows the user to search for items sold, display the items and frequency, and also show a histogram of the data as it is interpreted. The program also calculates the average of item sales and displays the most purchased items.

What did you do particularly well?
- I am quite proud of my growing familiarity with output stream formatting. While I anticipate that this skill will be less useful when I eventually move on to graphical output of graphs and charts, I very much enjoy seeing a well formatted output in the console.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- The biggest enhancement I could make to this code is to remove the ItemFreq class and use maps to do the same thing. While the execution of the program would essentially remain unchanged, using a standard library contain would make the code more simple and thus easier to move around and use outside of my local machine.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- The most challenging piece for me was writing the logic that counts the item frequency once the input file is read. I strugle to visualize nested loops easily. My biggest help comes from resources such as stack overflow where I can see other's solutions to the problem and thus come up with something that makes sense in the context of my program and that I can more easily understand.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- For one, the nCharString function that I wrote all the way back in project one is very useful for any sort of console output formatting. Other than that, I think having an understanding of C++ makes coding in essentially every other language that I do more easy to understand. I learned very much about python throughout this course (as an example) due to doing searches about how Python handles garbage collection and what (if any) concept of pointers there are in python.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I made this program maintainable by including comments explaining what every function does and also by writing documentation that steps through the execution of the program. I also used the coding standard introduced in project 2 to make the code formatted in a common way to others within the psuedo company I wrote this for. This would allow someone to quickly read about what the program does and how it does it, which allows them to make easy modifications from there.
